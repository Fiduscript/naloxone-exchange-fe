# Fiduscript

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.0.8.

## Getting started

- Install angular-cli globally by running `sudo npm install -g @angular/cli` .
- Install all remaining dependencies by running `npm install` in the project root.
- Run post-install script `npm run postinstall`

## Development server

Run `npm run dev-server` to start back-end and front-end server tasks. Navigate to `http://localhost:8080/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Production server

Run `npm run prod-server` to compile code and start the server. Navigate to `http://localhost:8080/` to use the app. The server will run with the compiled files in the `dist/` directory; it will not refresh on changes to source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

__Note:__ SkullJack uses `.pug` and `.styl` files instead of the auto generated `.html` and `.css` files. If you generate a component or module make sure to rename these!

## Build

Run `npm run build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
