        h5 Q: What does it mean to be an appropriate partner pharmacy?
        p A: While Naloxone can now be ordered from a pharmacy, in most states it cannot be shipped outside of state lines. Thus, Naloxone Exchange routes orders to partner pharmacies that reside within the same state as the shipping address of the order.
