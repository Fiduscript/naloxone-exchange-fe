      h5.question Q: What does it mean to be an appropriate partner pharmacy?
      p A: While Naloxone can now be ordered without a prescription from a pharmacy, it cannot be shipped outside of state lines. Thus, NE routes orders to partner pharmacies that reside within the same state as the shipping address of the order.
